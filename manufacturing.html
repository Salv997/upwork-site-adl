                            Typical of the best craftsmanship, manual knotting is an ancient 
                            manufacturing technique based on the patient work of master weavers that skillfully create high quality 
                            carpets, also very resistant and 
                            durable over time. The process involves several craftsmen who create 
                            the carpet design by knotting the warp threads on a vertical loom. 
                            The accuracy of the design and, consequently, the value of the handicraft depend on the number of 
                            knots on its back side. Manual knotting is possible with fibers such as wool, natural silk, botany silk and 
                            viscose.

                            Tufting is a type of textile weaving in which yarn tufts are inserted manually 
                            with a tool called tufted gun onto a cotton backing traced with a design. 
                            The resulting carpet can then be sheared to create the desired effects. At 
                            the end of the process, in order to compact the fibers, the carpet is finished 
                            with a cotton fabric applied to the back. Applicable to wool, natural silk, 
                            botany silk and viscose, hand-tufting allows an unlimited choice of design, 
                            shape and color and represents an ideal solution for contract furnishing

                            Prized for its softness, warmth and natural strength, sheep’s wool 
                            has been used in myriad ways for thousands of years. Its unique natural 
                            properties mean that it is water repellent and flame retardant. 
                            Our Tibetan wool is collected from the fleeces of sheep living on 
                            the Himalayan plateau at high altitudes of up to 17,000 feet. Their 
                            wool is unusually strong and springy and is renowned for being 
                            exceptionally rich in lanolin, a natural stain barrier. Once collected, 
                            the wool is washed and hand-spun into soft yarns. The rich texture 
                            and long unbroken fibres mean it provides excellent durability and 
                            a wonderful texture underfoot. We believe it is the very best wool in 
                            the world for making rugs.
