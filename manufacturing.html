                We strive to create meaningful handmade pieces where design blends with art and craftmanship using 
                passion, creativity and experience. The ancient art of rug making is a practiced by many, yet understood 
                by a precious few. Distant from mass production we aim to offer meticulously crafted rugs to discerning 
                individuals who appreciate the finer things in life, seek and enjoy a high end product, where a long 
                production time encapsulates the timeless heritage of rich culture. We are committed not only to preserving 
                traditional craftsmanship but also supporting the artisans who create these rugs. Our artisans come from 
                communities where rug-making has been a part of their cultural heritage for generations, and their skills 
                are passed down from one generation to the next. More than a rug, every piece is a powerful expression of 
                the limitless imagination and uniqueness of the human spirit, a tale of dedication and artistry that speak 
                of the artisan’s pursuit of perfection, and an embodiment of dreams woven into reality.

                        <p>
                            Hand-tufting is a remarkable textile weaving technique that requires 
                            the skillful hands of artisans to manually insert yarn tufts 
                            onto a cotton backing using a tool called a tufting gun. The cotton 
                            backing acts as a canvas that features the rug’s traced design, and 
                            by shooting yarn through the tufting gun into the fabric frame, 
                            these artisans bring the design to life. Meticulously cut and 
                            shaved with specialized scissors, the yarn transforms into captivating 
                            curved patterns and piles of varying heights and densities 
                            showcasing the weaver’s artistic prowess. Hand tufting is an art 
                            form without limits, where the realm of materials and design 
                            possibilities expands infinitely. From a rich selection of materials 
                            to an endless array of designs, shapes, and colors, the creative 
                            potential knows no bounds, offering a limitless playground for 
                            artistic exploration. The end result of the hand tufting process 
                            is a one-of-a-kind, handcrafted rug. Each rug bears the mark of 
                            the artisan’s expertise and creativity, exhibiting a luxurious feel, 
                            intricate design, and exceptional visual appeal.

                            In the enchanting world of hand-tufted rugs, the journey begins with a vibrant 
                            splash of color. Before the artistry unfolds, the yarns undergo a meticulous 
                            dyeing process, ensuring each hue is a true masterpiece in its own 
                            right. This process gives the first level of uniqueness to each rug because 
                            no two dye baths are ever the same. Artisans skillfully wind the yarn onto 
                            a wheel-like frame, and it is then immersed into boiling cauldrons of dye, 
                            where its fibers absorb the chosen colors. Basking in the sun, the yarns 
                            dry with renewed vibrancy and then the weavers spin them into balls. To 
                            guide their skilled hands, a color card is also crafted, each color is assigned 
                            a number, harmonizing the palette with the weaving pattern.

                            The creation of a graph serves as a blueprint, guiding artisans on their 
                            journey to bring intricate designs to life. By transferring the design onto 
                            specialized graph paper or digital software, each stitch is granted meticulous 
                            precision and flawless alignment. With its grid-like structure, each 
                            square becomes a sacred space, cradling a specific tuft and reverencing the 
                            art of attention to detail. Crafting this graph demands unwavering dedication 
                            and a profound comprehension of the design’s intricacies, showcasing 
                            the artisans’ artistry and skill. It is a testament to the artisans’ mastery, 
                            leading them through the transformative process of transforming a blank 
                            canvas into a captivating hand-tufted rug.

                            artisans select the yarn colors and load the gun with a spool of creative potential. 
                            The tufting gun becomes an extension of their skilled hands ready 
                            to weave magic into the fabric: the artisans skillfully maneuver the tufting 
                            gun along the previously crafted graph, crafting loops and gradually building up 
                            the desired pattern.

                            As the tufting process comes to an end, the rug is finally freed from its 
                            frame. At this stage, the loops of yarn on the front side remain intact, 
                            creating a looped pile surface. Now this is where the true artistry of carving 
                            comes into play, as craftsmen work their magic by trimming or cutting 
                            specific areas to add depth and dimension. The rug is then carefully backed 
                            with a secondary material ensuring the yarn tufts stay firmly in place while 
                            also adding structural support. Finally, the hand-tufted rug is brought to 
                            life with the final touches: every tuft, every thread, and every contour is 
                            examined to ensure the rug is nothing less than a masterpiece. This is the 
                            culmination of a process that has been a labor of love from start to finish. 
                            Every step, from the tufting to the carving and backing, has been carefully 
                            executed to create a rug that is not only beautiful but also tells a story.

                            Sheep’s wool, a timeless gem in the world of rug-making, has earned its 
                            esteemed reputation for unmatched durability and innate softness. With 
                            yarns that can be knotted, woven, or tufted, it allows for versatile production. 
                            At the heart of our craft lies the pursuit of excellence, which is why 
                            we choose the extraordinary quality of New Zealand wool. This coarse yet 
                            robust wool ensures longevity, while its pristine whiteness enhances the 
                            dyeing process, resulting in vibrant hues. As a renewable and eco-friendly 
                            fiber, wool aligns perfectly with our commitment to sustainability. And to 
                            add even more intrigue, we also work with angora, cashmere, alpaca, and

                            there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean. This ecological yarn is created exclusively 
                            from post-consumer PET plastic bottles that have been converted into fibers using an innovative process. 
                            These fibers are then spun into yarn, which maintains an extraordinary 
                            level of softness while also possessing uncompromised qualities such as water repellency, 
                            flame retardancy, UV resistance, and stain and mildew resistance. Additionally, recycled
